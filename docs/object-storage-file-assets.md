# Object-Storage File Assets

RemoteLab can offload large session attachments to an external S3-compatible object store instead of pushing the full file body through the main `7690` chat service.

Current MVP scope:

- browser / client asks RemoteLab for an upload intent
- client uploads the file directly to object storage via presigned `PUT`
- RemoteLab stores a session-bound file-asset record
- session messages can attach that asset by `assetId`
- the detached runner localizes the asset to local disk right before tool execution
- successful CLI workflows can publish generated local result files back into the session as downloadable asset attachments
- downloads go through a stable RemoteLab route that redirects to object storage

This keeps large byte transfer off the main chat service while preserving the existing session/run model.

## Environment

Set these variables before starting `chat-server.mjs`:

```bash
export REMOTELAB_ASSET_STORAGE_BASE_URL="https://<storage-endpoint>/<bucket>"
export REMOTELAB_ASSET_STORAGE_REGION="auto"
export REMOTELAB_ASSET_STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY_ID="..."
export REMOTELAB_ASSET_STORAGE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="..."

# Optional
export REMOTELAB_ASSET_STORAGE_PROVIDER="s3"
export REMOTELAB_ASSET_STORAGE_PUBLIC_BASE_URL="https://<cdn-or-public-bucket-origin>"
export REMOTELAB_ASSET_STORAGE_KEY_PREFIX="session-assets"
export REMOTELAB_ASSET_STORAGE_PRESIGN_TTL_SECONDS="3600"
export REMOTELAB_ASSET_DIRECT_UPLOAD_ENABLED="1"
```

Examples:

- Cloudflare R2: `https://<accountid>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/<bucket>`
- Path-style S3: `https://s3.<region>.amazonaws.com/<bucket>`
- Virtual-host S3: `https://<bucket>.s3.<region>.amazonaws.com`
- Volcengine TOS: `https://<bucket>.tos-<region>.volces.com`

If `REMOTELAB_ASSET_STORAGE_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` is set, download redirects can use that stable public origin. Otherwise RemoteLab generates fresh presigned `GET` URLs on demand.

For Volcengine TOS, set `REMOTELAB_ASSET_STORAGE_PROVIDER="tos"` unless you already use a `*.volces.com` endpoint that RemoteLab can auto-detect. TOS uses its own `X-Tos-*` signing scheme rather than AWS `X-Amz-*`, so generic S3-style presigning is not enough.

If you provide a path-style TOS base URL like `https://tos-cn-beijing.volces.com/<bucket>`, RemoteLab rewrites it to the required virtual-host form automatically.

If your bucket is private, leave `REMOTELAB_ASSET_STORAGE_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` unset so downloads keep using short-lived presigned `GET` URLs.

If bucket CORS is not ready yet, set `REMOTELAB_ASSET_DIRECT_UPLOAD_ENABLED="0"`. RemoteLab still offloads server-published files and can re-publish server-ingested uploads into object storage after receipt, while the browser keeps using the older non-direct-upload path.

## Browser CORS

For browser direct uploads, the bucket must allow cross-origin `PUT` from your RemoteLab origin.

Allow at least:

- methods: `PUT`, `GET`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`
- headers: `content-type`
- origins: your RemoteLab app origin
- exposed headers: `etag` if you want the browser to see it

For example, if your main RemoteLab host is `https://remotelab.example.com`, that exact origin needs to be present in the bucket CORS rules before browser-direct uploads can work.

RemoteLab also extends page CSP automatically to allow the configured object-storage origins for direct uploads and media previews.

## Current limitations

- Uploads are single-request presigned `PUT`s, not resumable multipart uploads yet.
- File assets are currently session-bound for access control.
- The runner localizes attached assets just before execution; very large files still take time to pull onto the worker machine.
- Automatic result publication currently relies on detecting successful output-file paths from tool command output; highly custom workflows may still need explicit publishing hooks.
